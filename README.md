# House-Price-Prediction

The "House Price Prediction" project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of residential properties based on various features and attributes.

By analyzing historical housing data and relevant factors, the project aims to provide accurate price estimates to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making 
informed decisions.
    
Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, support vector regression, and ensemble learning techniques have been utilized to achieve accurate predictions.
